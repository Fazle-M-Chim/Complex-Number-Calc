This is a Python program that allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations on complex numbers. It includes a class for representing complex numbers and overloads the standard arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) and the built-in abs() function to work with complex numbers. Additionally, the len() function is overloaded to calculate the magnitude of a complex number.

The program is designed to be easy to use and customizable. You can create instances of the ComplexNumber class and perform operations on them, or you can modify the code to suit your specific needs.

Features:

    Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of complex numbers
    Overloaded len() function to calculate the magnitude of a complex number
    Overloaded > and < functions to check greater than and less than
    Customizable ComplexNumber class for advanced use cases

Installation:
